1. Auto-Weka:
* requries jvm which consumes by itself large amount of memory 
* failures on large datasets with small time budgets

2. TPOT:
* doesn't terminate when time budget finished exactly which leads to some failures as we terminate it manually
* many failures at small time budgets

3. Recipe:
* not stable with many technical issues
* depend on python 2 which will be deprecated on 2020
* failures with many medium and large size datasets especially in small time budgets
* doesn't terminate when time budget finished exactly which leads to some failures as we terminate it manually

4. SmartML:
* bad memory management in R that leads to memory leaks and inability to deal with large datasets except sampling
* using multiple R packages with different interfaces unlike scikit learn in python and weka in java
* not comprehensive like scikit learn and weka
* R Studio server used in running the experiements itself has high memory and cpu consumption

5. Auto-Sklearn:
* some memory leaks that leads to failures in some datasets in the 4 hrs experiements
