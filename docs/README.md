# AutoML Micro Analysis
In this study, we focus on the Microlevel by empirically evaluating and analyzing the performance impact of several design decisions and parameters including meta-learning,ensembling,time budget and size of search space,separately and combined. The results of our study reveal various interesting insights that can significantly guide and impact the design of AutoML frameworks.
